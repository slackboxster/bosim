The project was written in QT4. My system is a 64 bit intel processor, but I'm running a 32 bit linux.

writeup.pdf is a basic writeup of the system intended not only for not only you but also any student that may use the system.

src contains the source code of the project, including the QT project file.

bosim is the actual binary compiled in release form on my system. ./bosim should execute the demonstration simply and nicely.
